Simple TextStyling addon that adds support for Markdown sythax (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

For now this addon is not part of XDocreport itself because it depends on JMD lib that is not available in Maven Central Repo.

The JMD lib comes from GitHub, and for now we rely on a custom build that is hosted in Nuxeo repo.
